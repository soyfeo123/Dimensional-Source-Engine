# Dimensional-Source-Engine
Dimensional Source Engine is an open source game engine made with C#.
DSE is a project, made out of boredom, using a framework called 'MonoGame".
(THIS GAME ENGINE IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED, THE ONLY THING FUNCTIONAL SO FAR IS THE MAIN MENU UI.)

# About this project
This project was born when I decided to make a game engine similar to Valve's Source Engine, but with 2D.
I was also interested with making a game purely with C#, no game engine.
It has a similar file structure to Source Engine's, which makes it easier for Source nerds to try out DSE.

You can either make a mod, or compile the code by yourself, and make a whole entire game.
By the way, this project is COMPLETELY open source, no code locked, you can edit it all you want, make the scariest thing of your life, or make a life changing game. It's all yours.

An example of a game made in this game engine is Quarter-Life 1 being made by, well, me.

# How to compile the code
- Make sure you have MonoGame installed into your Visual Studio 2022 (Use vs2022, or else it might not work.).
- Clone the master branch.
- Open the cloned project in Visual Studio 2022.
- Make your changes to the code.
- Build the DimensionalSourceEngine project.
- Go to the DimensionalSourceEngine project root, then go to bin > Debug > net6.0-windows.
- Copy the "ql1" folder from the solution root over to the game folder. (ql1 is basically the whole Quarter-Life 1 game, also known as the root of this game engine.)
- Run "ql1.exe".
- Done!
- (OPTIONAL) Make it fullscreen by going to ql1 > cfg > game_settings.cfg and editing the "fullScreen' value to be true.

# About Quarter-Life 1
This is an example of a game made in this game engine.
As you can clearly see in the title, this game is inspired by Half-Life 1, made in GoldSrc by Valve.

Fun fact about GoldSrc: It's a heavily modified version of the Quake engine.

# Random fun facts
I am yet to activate windows.
This game engine is made with C#, and a framework called MonoGame, and a couple of font libraries. (I don't wanna use spritefont)
This game engine is made with .NET Core 6.0 for Windows.
You have to have .NET Core or something installed for this game engine to run.

# Okay that's it
Go crazy with this game engine.
